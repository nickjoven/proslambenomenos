# PREDICTIONS — preregistration ledger (append-only)

A prediction is registered BEFORE the work it covers runs: what will
be attempted, the expected outcome, and what result would change the
author's mind. The gate (scripts/check_predictions.py) enforces the
"pre-": the commit that registers a prediction must be an ancestor of
the commit that introduces the claim citing it, and the protected
remote makes that ordering third-party-attested (history behind a
pushed commit cannot be rewritten). Resolutions are appended as R-n
entries; nothing is edited in place.

Scope rule (mechanical): claims created after this ledger's first
commit that carry numeric_match or novelty checked-novel MUST cite a
prediction; LITCHECKS entries added after it MUST cite one. Everything
else may cite one, and any citation is checked for existence and
ordering.

## P-1 — 2026-08-20 — the XOR spectrum-to-tree bridge
expects: no canonical map exists from the twisted-bundle Fourier
parity to Stern-Brocot denominator parity - the attempt resolves as
an under-determination result (the audit's 1,764-pairs-both-ways
evidence and the source doc's own admission that the parity object
is not forced both point there).
changes-my-mind: an explicit, natural construction that fixes
denominator parity uniquely from the orientation-bundle character,
with a proof that rival parity objects (numerator, sum) are excluded
rather than unconsidered.

## P-2 — 2026-08-20 — the two-anchor minimum
expects: partial rigorization - the non-smoothness of the locked
measure at K = 1 (Jensen-Bak-Bohr) is provable as a statement about
the circle-map family, but the physical framing ("two dimensional
anchors are therefore the minimum") remains interpretive and does
not follow from the lemma alone.
changes-my-mind: a derivation in which the anchor count is forced by
the lemma without an added modeling premise; or a counterexample
showing the locked measure is smoother at K = 1 than the classical
result is being read to say.

## P-3 — 2026-08-20 — the Iwasawa one-stage claim
expects: the v1 statement ("every nontrivial continuous subgroup
kills exactly one Iwasawa stage") is FALSE as stated - 2-dimensional
Borel subgroups absorb two factors - and a corrected, weaker
statement is provable; the dimension-3 conclusion survives under the
corrected version.
changes-my-mind: a proof of the original statement handling the
Borel case, or a failure to salvage any corrected version, which
would also reopen the dimension conclusion's support.
